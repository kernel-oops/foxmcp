"""
Tests for what stdio mode changes inside the server, short of running it

The transport itself is covered by tests/integration/test_stdio_transport.py,
which drives a real process. What is left here is the part that has no output to
observe: the MCP port that stdio mode must not go looking for, and the rule that
nothing in server/ may write to stdout, which is easy to break by accident a year
from now and impossible to see in a test that does not use stdio.
