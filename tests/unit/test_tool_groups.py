"""
Tests for leaving tool groups unregistered

A tool's description sits in the client's context for the whole session whether
or not it is ever called, so a user who never touches bookmarks still pays for
them on every request. --disable-tools drops a group before registration, which
is the only way to keep it out of that context - a tool that is registered and
merely rejected at call time still costs its description.

--enable-tools names one tool to register anyway, for the case where a single
tool out of a disabled group is the one that is wanted - a screenshot without
the five other tab tools, which is what issue #6 asked for.

The tests worth having here are the ones that catch drift: that the groups
partition the tool surface, so a tool added tomorrow cannot be silently
unreachable by the option, that a tool named individually outlives its group,
and that a mistyped name is refused rather than quietly ignored.
