## v1.2.0 - Security and Context (2026-08-14)

### 🔒 Security Release

**Upgrade if you run any earlier version.** Before v1.2.0 the extension WebSocket
accepted any connection on its localhost port, and WebSocket handshakes are exempt
from the same-origin policy — so any web page you visited could take the connection
and answer browser requests on the extension's behalf. The server now accepts only
`moz-extension://` origins.

### ✨ What else is in it

- **Response bodies are actually captured.** They never were: the old approach
  overrode `window.fetch` from a content script, which Firefox silently refuses.
  Bodies now come from the response stream, and cover the document load as well.
- **`--disable-tools` shrinks the tool surface** your MCP client carries, one group
  at a time — `windows`, `tabs`, `bookmarks`, `navigation`, `content`, `requests`,
  `history`, `debug`. Every group stays on by default.
- **`tabs_move`**, plus a `tabs_list` that can finally see other windows.
- **Releases are built in public** by GitHub Actions and carry a signed provenance
  attestation: `gh attestation verify 'foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi' --repo ThinkerYzu/foxmcp`.
  That needs GitHub CLI **2.49 or newer**. An older `gh` has no `attestation`
  subcommand and answers by printing its list of commands, which reads as a missing
  attestation rather than an out-of-date client — Ubuntu 26.04 still packages 2.46,
  so install from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) if apt is your source.
  The attestation can also be read straight from the API, with no `gh` at all:
  `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/attestations/sha256:$(sha256sum 'foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi' | cut -d' ' -f1)`.

### ⚠️ Breaking

`get_last_focused_window` is removed. It returned the same window as
`get_current_window` in every case this extension can produce, so no behavior
changes — but a client that names the old tool gets an error. Use
`get_current_window`.

### 📋 Upgrading

Install the new XPI as you installed the old one, and restart the server. The
extension asks for one new permission, `webRequestBlocking`, which is what Firefox
requires before it will hand an extension the response stream; nothing blocks,
cancels or rewrites a request. It has no description string in Gecko, so it raises
no new install prompt.

## v1.1.0 - Enhanced Automation (2025-10-26)

### 🚀 Feature Release

**FoxMCP v1.1.0** adds powerful new capabilities for web request monitoring, enhanced bookmark management, and ready-to-use automation scripts. This release builds on the solid v1.0.0 foundation with practical features for common automation tasks.

### ✨ New Features

#### **Web Request Monitoring API**
Monitor and capture HTTP requests/responses in real-time:
- **Start Monitoring**: `requests_start_monitoring()` - Begin capturing network activity
- **List Captured Data**: `requests_list_captured()` - Retrieve captured requests/responses
- **Stop Monitoring**: `requests_stop_monitoring()` - End capture session and cleanup
- **Two-Phase Workflow**: Start monitoring → perform actions → retrieve data → stop
- **Use Cases**: Debug API calls, analyze network traffic, validate request patterns

#### **Enhanced Bookmark Management**
New bookmark operations for better organization:
- **Folder Creation**: Create bookmark folders with proper hierarchy support
- **Update Bookmarks**: Modify existing bookmark titles, URLs, and locations
- **Improved Reliability**: Fixed integration test failures and enhanced error handling

#### **Predefined Scripts Collection**
Ready-to-use scripts for common automation tasks:

**YouTube Control** (`youtube-play-pause.sh`)
- Play, pause, or toggle YouTube videos programmatically
- Returns video state, current time, and duration
- Example: `content_execute_predefined(tab_id, "youtube-play-pause.sh", "[]")`

**DOM Simplification** (`dom-summarize.sh`)
- Simplify complex DOM trees for AI agent understanding
- Extract visible interactive elements with persistent IDs
- Supports viewport-only filtering and position data
- Example: `content_execute_predefined(tab_id, "dom-summarize.sh", "[\"onscreen\"]")`

**Google Calendar Integration** (3 scripts)
- `gcal-cal-event-js.sh`: Extract specific event details by title, day, and time
- `gcal-daily-events-js.sh`: Get all events for a specific day
- `gcal-monthly-events-js.sh`: Extract entire month view with statistics
- Perfect for calendar automation and event management

#### **Content API Enhancement**
- **max_length Parameter**: Optional parameter for `content_get_text` tool

  - Affects `history_query` and `history_get_recent` tools

#### **Other Fixes**
- **Bookmark Tests**: Fixed intermittent bookmark management test failures
- **Calendar Script**: Fixed gcal-daily-events-js.sh month detection
