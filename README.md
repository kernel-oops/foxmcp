# FoxMCP - Firefox Browser Automation via MCP

A Firefox extension that exposes browser functionality to AI assistants and automation tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Control tabs, history, bookmarks, navigation, content, and windows programmatically.

## ⚠️ Privacy Notice

**FoxMCP enables AI access to your browser data.** Use only with trusted AI services and consider using dedicated browser profiles for testing.

## Features

- **Complete Browser Control**: Tabs, windows, navigation, bookmarks, history
- **Web Request Monitoring**: Monitor and analyze HTTP requests with configurable filtering
- **Content Access**: Extract text, HTML, execute JavaScript in pages
- **MCP Integration**: Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and other MCP clients
- **Custom Scripts**: Execute parameterized scripts in browser tabs
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based with automatic reconnection
- **Security**: Localhost-only operation with comprehensive input validation. Web pages are kept off both ports deliberately; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Install from GitHub Release (Recommended)

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/releases/download/v1.3.0/install-from-github.sh | bash
```

This script automatically:
- Downloads the latest v1.3.0 release binaries
- Sets up Python virtual environment and dependencies
- Downloads the Firefox extension and installation script
- Creates CLAUDE.md for Claude Code integration
- Downloads Google Calendar automation scripts to predefined-scripts/ directory
- Optionally connects to Claude Code
- Creates a startup script for easy server management

**Install Firefox Extension:**

After running the installation script, install the FoxMCP extension from Firefox Add-ons:
- Visit: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxmcp/
- Click "Add to Firefox"

### Option 2: Install from Source

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp.git
cd foxmcp

# Create venv/ and install the server dependencies into it
make install
```

Python 3.10 or newer is required — `fastmcp` 3 does not install on anything older.
Development and CI run 3.14, and 3.12 is verified. `make install` creates `venv/` and
installs `server/requirements.txt` into it; use `make setup` instead if you also want
to run the test suite, which adds `tests/requirements.txt`.

You also need `make`, `zip` and Python's `venv` module, none of which a stock Ubuntu
has: `sudo apt install make zip python3-venv`. Without `python3-venv`, `make install`
stops at "The virtual environment was not created successfully"; without `zip`,
`make package` cannot build the XPI.

#### 2. Build & Install Extension

```bash
# Build and package extension
make package
```

**Your Firefox channel decides which methods are available.** Release and Beta
builds enforce extension signing and ignore `xpinstall.signatures.required`, so an
unsigned XPI cannot be installed permanently on them — only Nightly, Developer
Edition and unbranded builds honour that preference, which Methods 2 and 3 depend
on. On Release or Beta, either install the signed copy from
[Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxmcp/), or use
Method 1, which loads an unsigned XPI temporarily until Firefox restarts.

**Install in Firefox (Method 1 - Temporary Add-on)**:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox"
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
5. Select `dist/packages/foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi`

**Install in Firefox (Method 2 - Persistent with Preferences)**:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to `about:config` (accept the warning)
3. Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`
4. Set `extensions.experiments.enabled` to `true` (if needed)
5. Go to `about:addons`
6. Click gear icon (⚙️) → "Install Add-on From File"
7. Select `dist/packages/foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi`

**Install in Firefox (Method 3 - Automated Script)**:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Close Firefox completely first!
# Find your profile directory in about:profiles, then:
./scripts/install-xpi.sh /path/to/firefox/profile
```

This script automatically:
- Installs the extension to your Firefox profile
- Configures Firefox to allow unsigned extensions
- Handles existing installations and preferences

**Then enable it by hand.** Start Firefox, open `about:addons`, and turn FoxMCP on.
Firefox installs an extension dropped into a profile in the disabled state and
requires a person to enable it — no script can do that step, and until you do, the
extension is present, listed, and not running. Methods 1 and 2 install through the
browser, so they do not need it.

**Note**: Method 1 requires reinstalling after Firefox restarts. Method 2 requires manual preference changes. Method 3 is the least manual of the persistent options, on a channel that allows unsigned extensions — but it still needs that one click.

### 3. Start Server

**If you used the GitHub installation script:**
```bash
# Use the provided startup script
./start-foxmcp.sh
```

**If you installed from source:**
```bash
# Start both WebSocket and MCP servers
make run-server

# Or the same thing by hand — note the interpreter, which is the one make uses
venv/bin/python server/server.py
```

Neither needs the virtual environment activated: both name `venv/bin/python`
directly. Activating it first (`source venv/bin/activate`) is fine too.

The server will start on:
- **WebSocket**: `localhost:8765` (for Firefox extension)
- **MCP Server**: `localhost:3000` (for AI clients)

### 4. Connect Your AI Client

**For Claude Code**:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http foxmcp http://localhost:3000/mcp/
```

**For Other MCP Clients**:
Connect to `http://localhost:3000/mcp/`

**Or let the client start the server.** With `--stdio` the server speaks MCP on
stdin and stdout instead of HTTP, so a client launches it on demand and there is
no step 3 to remember:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project foxmcp -- $PWD/venv/bin/python \
  $PWD/server/server.py --stdio
```

The extension connects the same way it always does, but two costs come with this
mode. Only one server can serve the extension, and under stdio every client
launches its own, so two `claude` sessions at once means the second one gets no
browser tools. And the server lives only as long as your client, while the
extension stops trying to reconnect after about four minutes without one.

If you run several clients, or short terminal sessions through the day, HTTP mode
is the easier setup. Read [One session at a
time](docs/configuration.md#one-session-at-a-time) and [The reconnect
gap](docs/configuration.md#the-reconnect-gap) first. The same page has the
`.mcp.json` any client can use.

## Basic Usage

Once connected, you can control Firefox through natural language:

```
"List all open tabs"
"Create a new tab with example.com"
"Get the text content from the current page"
"Search my browsing history for python tutorials"
"Take a screenshot of the current tab"
"Execute JavaScript: document.title"
```

## Available Functions

### Tab Management
- List, create, close, and switch between tabs
- Take screenshots of tabs (PNG/JPEG)
- Cross-window tab creation
- Reorder tabs, or move them into another window — including gathering the tabs for one
  site into a window of their own

### Content Interaction
- Extract page text and HTML
- Execute JavaScript in pages
- Run custom predefined scripts

### Navigation
- Back, forward, reload pages
- Navigate to specific URLs
- Cache control options

### History & Bookmarks
- Search browsing history
- List and search bookmarks
- Create and delete bookmarks
- Create bookmark folders and organize bookmarks hierarchically
- Update bookmark and folder titles and URLs

### Web Request Monitoring
- Monitor HTTP requests with URL pattern filtering
- Capture response headers and bodies, including the document load
- Text bodies come back as text — JSON and `text/*` by default, configurable per
  monitor. A binary response reports its size, not its bytes
- Start, list, read and stop; several monitors can run at once. Captured data lives
  in the extension for as long as it runs, and nothing is written to disk

### Window Management
- List, create, close, and focus windows
- Resize and position windows
- Window state management (minimize, maximize)

## Configuration

### Server Options

```bash
# Custom ports
python server/server.py --port 9000 --mcp-port 4000

# WebSocket only (no MCP)
python server/server.py --no-mcp

# MCP on stdin/stdout, for a client that launches the server itself
python server/server.py --stdio

# Bind a different host
python server/server.py --host 127.0.0.1

# Offer fewer tools, to keep them out of the MCP client's context
python server/server.py --disable-tools bookmarks,history

# Drop a group but keep one tool out of it
python server/server.py --disable-tools tabs --enable-tools tabs_capture_screenshot
```

All 35 tools are offered by default, costing an MCP client roughly 4,700 tokens of
context. `--disable-tools` leaves a group unregistered: `windows`, `tabs`,
`bookmarks`, `navigation`, `content`, `requests`, `history`, `debug`.
`--enable-tools` names individual tools to register anyway, for when one tool out
of a group is the one you want. See
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#reducing-the-tool-surface) for what
each group costs.

### Extension Configuration

Click the FoxMCP extension icon to configure:
- Server connection settings
- Retry intervals and timeouts
- Development/test mode options

## Custom Scripts

Create reusable JavaScript automation with external scripts:

### 1. Setup Script Directory
```bash
export FOXMCP_EXT_SCRIPTS="/path/to/your/scripts"
```

### 2. Create Executable Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# highlight_text.sh - Highlight text on page
search_text="${1:-example}"
echo "(function() {
  // JavaScript to highlight text
  return 'Highlighted: ' + search_text;
})()"
```

### 3. Use via MCP
```
"Run the highlight_text script with 'important' as the search term"
```

### 4. Claude Code Integration
The `claude-ex/` directory contains example CLAUDE.md templates that help Claude Code understand how to create predefined external scripts. Copy `claude-ex/CLAUDE.md.template` to your project's CLAUDE.md to enable Claude Code to:
- Understand your script creation workflow
- Help you create new predefined external scripts
- Provide context about foxmcp tools and capabilities

### 5. Available Predefined Scripts

The `predefined-ex/` directory includes ready-to-use scripts. To use them, point `FOXMCP_EXT_SCRIPTS` to the `predefined-ex/` directory:

```bash
export FOXMCP_EXT_SCRIPTS="/path/to/foxmcp/predefined-ex"
```

**YouTube Control** (`youtube-play-pause.sh`):
- Control YouTube video playback (play, pause, or toggle)
- Returns JSON with video state and playback position
- Usage: `youtube-play-pause.sh [play|pause|toggle]`

**Google Calendar Scripts**:
- `gcal-daily-events-js.sh` - Extract events for a specific day
- `gcal-monthly-events-js.sh` - Extract events for the entire month
- `gcal-cal-event-js.sh` - Extract detailed event information

**DOM Simplification** (`dom-summarize.sh`):
- Simplify complex DOM trees for AI agent understanding
- Shows only visible interactive elements
- Usage: `dom-summarize.sh [onscreen] [withpos]`

See [docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md) for detailed documentation on creating and using predefined scripts.

## Security

- **Localhost Only**: Server binds only to localhost interface
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **Script Security**: Predefined scripts use secure path validation
- **Permission Model**: Extension uses minimal required permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Connecting
1. Verify the WebSocket server is running: `curl -i http://localhost:8765`.
   A healthy answer is **426 Upgrade Required** — that is the WebSocket server
   turning away a plain HTTP request. Connection refused means it is not running
2. Check extension popup for connection status
3. Review browser console for errors

The server accepts WebSocket connections only from `moz-extension://` origins, so a
handshake from anything but the extension is rejected with 403 and logged.

### MCP Client Issues
1. Check the MCP server: `curl -i http://localhost:3000/mcp/`. A **307** redirect to
   `/mcp` means it is up; **connection refused** means it is not. A bare
   `curl http://localhost:3000` answers 404, which also proves the port is live
2. Verify client configuration matches server ports
3. Run the server in the foreground and watch its log output

### Permission Errors
1. Ensure virtual environment is activated
2. Check file permissions: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
3. Verify Firefox extension is properly installed
