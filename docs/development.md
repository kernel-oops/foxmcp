# Development Guide

Setup, workflow, and maintenance for FoxMCP development.

## Quick Cycle

1. `make setup` — install dependencies and create the test import symlinks
2. `make package` — build the extension XPI
3. Load the extension in Firefox (see [Loading in Firefox](#loading-in-firefox))
4. `make run-server` — start the server
5. `make test` — run the suite

## Commands

### Setup

```bash
make setup              # server + test dependencies, plus test import symlinks
make install            # server dependencies only
make setup-test-imports # recreate the test import symlinks
make dev                # setup, then upgrade pip
```

`setup` and `install` install into `venv/` explicitly, through `$(VENV_PIP)`. A bare
`pip` targets whatever interpreter happens to be active, which is how the venv once
ended up with the server dependencies but no pytest.

### Build

```bash
make build      # copy extension/ to dist/extension/
make package    # build, then create the XPI and server ZIP, then clear the profile cache
```

`package` produces `dist/packages/foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi` and
`dist/packages/foxmcp-server.zip`.

### Test

```bash
make test              # everything, with coverage
make test-unit         # unit only — fast, no Firefox
make test-integration  # integration only
make check             # lint + test
```

Expect **259 passing** in about ten minutes. See [`../tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md)
for the suite layout, fixtures, and troubleshooting.

### Other

```bash
make run-server   # start the WebSocket server
make lint         # flake8 over server/ and tests/
make format       # black + isort
make status       # ports, dependencies, symlink state
make clean        # build artifacts and symlinks
make clean-all    # also removes venv/
```

## Test Import System

Test files never manipulate `sys.path`. Importing `test_imports` first sets it up:

```python
import test_imports  # always the first import
from server.server import FoxMCPServer
from test_config import TEST_PORTS
```

`tests/test_imports.py` is the tracked file. The copies in `tests/unit/` and
`tests/integration/` are symlinks to it, created by `make setup-test-imports` (which
every `make test*` target runs first) and removed by `make clean`. They are not
tracked by git.

## Extension Development

### Loading in Firefox

| Method | Survives restart | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Temporary add-on | no | quick testing |
| `about:addons` install | yes | manual setup |
| `scripts/install-xpi.sh` | yes | development |

**Temporary add-on** — go to `about:debugging` → "This Firefox" → "Load Temporary
Add-on" → pick `dist/packages/foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi`.

**`about:addons`** — set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config`
first, then use the gear icon → "Install Add-on From File". Unsigned extensions cannot
be installed without that preference change.

**Script** — close Firefox completely, find your profile directory in `about:profiles`,
then:

```bash
./scripts/install-xpi.sh /path/to/firefox/profile
```

The script installs the XPI, sets `xpinstall.signatures.required = false` in `user.js`,
and fixes permissions. **Then enable the extension in `about:addons`** — Firefox
installs a profile-side extension disabled and waits for a person to turn it on. The
test suite gets around this by editing `extensions.json` directly, which is why the
suite never needed the click and a hand install does.

### Layout

```
extension/
├── manifest.json   # Extension configuration (Manifest V2)
├── background.js   # WebSocket client and action dispatch
├── content.js      # Content script injection
└── popup/          # Popup UI (html, js, css)
```

## Adding a Browser Function

Actions are namespaced with a dot — `tabs.list`, `windows.create`. The extension
dispatches on the part before the dot, then on the whole string.

**1. Handle it in the extension** (`extension/background.js`). Add a `case` to the
handler for its namespace:

```javascript
async function handleTabsAction(id, action, data) {
  try {
    switch (action) {
      case 'tabs.list':
        const tabs = await browser.tabs.query({ currentWindow: true });
        sendResponse(id, action, { tabs: tabs.map(/* ... */) });
        break;
```

A new namespace also needs a `case` in the top-level `switch (action.split('.')[0])`
and its own `handle<Name>Action` function.

**2. Expose it as an MCP tool** (`server/mcp_tools.py`). Tools are registered inside
the `_setup_*_tools` methods. The tool builds the request, waits for the reply, and
formats it for the caller:

```python
@self.mcp.tool()
async def tabs_list() -> str:
    """List all open browser tabs"""
    request = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "type": "request",
        "action": "tabs.list",
        "data": {},
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

    response = await self.websocket_server.send_request_and_wait(request)

    if "error" in response:
        return f"Error getting tabs: {response['error']}"
    ...
```

The docstring becomes the tool description that MCP clients see, so write it for them.

**3. Add a test** in `tests/integration/`, using the `server_with_extension` fixture.

**4. Rebuild before testing.** Test profiles are cached, so an extension edit has no
effect until you clear the cache:

```bash
make clean && make package && rm -rf dist/profile-cache/*
```

## Debugging

### Server

The server takes `--host`, `--port`, `--mcp-port`, `--no-mcp`, `--stdio`,
`--disable-tools` and `--enable-tools`:

```bash
cd server && python server.py --port 8767
```

Under `--stdio` the server's stdout carries the MCP protocol, so its logging —
and anything else with something to say — goes to stderr, where the client
collects it; most keep a log per MCP server. Nothing in `server/` may call
`print()`, and `tests/unit/test_stdio_mode.py` fails if something does.

### Extension

Extension logs are prefixed `[FoxMCP]`. Read them in the background script console at
`about:debugging` → "This Firefox" → "Inspect".

To forward extension logs to the server, set `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING_TO_SERVER = true`
near the top of `extension/background.js`, then rebuild and clear the profile cache.
**Set it back to `false` before committing.**

### Tests

```bash
cd tests && pytest -v -s                                    # verbose, unbuffered
cd tests && pytest integration/test_window_management.py -v  # one file
cd tests && pytest unit/test_server.py::test_name -v --pdb   # drop into the debugger
```

## Code Style

```bash
make format   # black + isort over server/ and tests/
make lint     # flake8, max line length 100
```

There is no JavaScript linting or formatting configured.

## Continuous Integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push to master and every pull request:
lint, unit tests, the full suite against a real Firefox, an install from source,
and a package build.

The install job is the one that follows README rather than the test harness. It
runs `make install` on a clean checkout — which nothing else does, since the other
jobs create the venv themselves — then starts the server and asks it for its tools
over HTTP as a real MCP client would, checking the count with every group enabled
and with two groups disabled. To do the same by hand:

```bash
venv/bin/python server/server.py --port 18765 --mcp-port 13000 &
venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client
async def main():
    async with Client('http://localhost:13000/mcp/') as c:
        print(len(await c.list_tools()))
asyncio.run(main())"
```

The suite job installs Firefox Developer Edition rather than release. The tests
drop an unsigned XPI into the profile, which needs
`xpinstall.signatures.required=false` to be honoured, and only Nightly,
Developer Edition and unbranded builds honour it — release and beta enforce
signing regardless, so the extension never loads and every browser test fails.
Pass `channel: nightly` to `.github/actions/setup-firefox` to test against
tomorrow's Firefox.

The job also fails if any test was *skipped*. Everything that touches the
browser skips rather than fails when Firefox is unusable, so without that guard
a broken runner would produce a green build of a suite that never opened a
browser.

### Test against the Firefox CI uses, not the one you have

`test_response_body_capture_verification` passed on the maintainer's Nightly for
months while failing on CI, because the two builds disagreed about
`details.responseSize` on `onCompleted`: Nightly reported the transferred bytes,
Developer Edition reported `0`. The test read that value, so it passed on one
machine and failed on the other with no code difference at all.

Set `FIREFOX_PATH` to a Developer Edition build before concluding that a browser
test is fine.

## Release Process

1. Bump the version in `extension/manifest.json`, `package.json`,
   `scripts/install-from-github.sh` and the install URL in `README.md`
2. Rename `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to `## [1.2.0] - <date>` and add
   the link reference at the bottom
3. `scripts/check-version.sh 1.2.0` — fails unless all five files agree
4. Commit, then tag: `git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "..."` and push the tag

Pushing the tag is the whole release. `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-checks
the version, runs the full suite, builds the artifacts, publishes a signed
provenance attestation for them, creates the GitHub release with notes taken
from the changelog section, and submits the extension to addons.mozilla.org.

The AMO step runs in the `amo` deployment environment, which holds the API
credentials and requires a human to approve the deployment. Nothing else in
either workflow can reach those secrets.

To rehearse without releasing anything, run the workflow by hand from the
Actions tab and give it a version. It verifies and builds; it publishes nothing
and never touches AMO.

There is no release script to run. `release-commands.sh` used to sit in the
repository root and was deleted in 1.2.0; if you find a copy, it is not the
release path and running it would commit your working tree under a v1.1.0
message.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Import errors in tests | `make setup-test-imports` |
| `No module named pytest` | `venv/bin/pip install -r tests/requirements.txt` |
| Firefox not found | Set `FIREFOX_PATH`; tests otherwise search `PATH` |
| Extension edit has no effect | `make clean && make package && rm -rf dist/profile-cache/*` |
| Extension not loading | Check `about:debugging` for errors |
| Port conflict | Pass `--port` / `--mcp-port` |

## Security Notes

The server binds to localhost only and is never exposed to a network. Predefined
scripts pass through a path validation chain before execution — see
[`scripts.md`](scripts.md). Error messages should not leak internal paths or state.
