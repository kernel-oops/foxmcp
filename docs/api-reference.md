# FoxMCP API Reference

Complete reference for all MCP tools and browser functions available through FoxMCP.

## Available MCP Tools

All 35 tools are offered by default. Each section below corresponds to a *group*
that `--disable-tools` can leave unregistered, which is how you shrink what an MCP
client carries in its context. The group name is the tool-name prefix, not the
heading: Tab Management is `tabs`, Web Request Monitoring is `requests`, Debugging
Tools is `debug`. `--enable-tools` takes the tool names below, for keeping one
tool out of a group you disabled. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md#reducing-the-tool-surface) for the full list
and what each group costs.

### Tab Management
- `tabs_list(window_id=None)` - List open tabs, in every window or in one window
  - Each line ends with `[window {window_id}, index {index}]`; the index is the tab's
    position in its window, counting from 0
- `tabs_create(url, active=True, pinned=False, window_id=None)` - Create new tab (optionally in specific window)
- `tabs_close(tab_id)` - Close specific tab
- `tabs_switch(tab_id)` - Switch to specific tab
- `tabs_move(tab_ids, window_id=None, index=-1)` - Move tabs to a position, optionally into another window
  - `tab_ids` takes one ID, a list, or a JSON string such as `"[12, 15]"`
  - `index` is the destination, counting from 0; `-1` is the end
  - Without `window_id`, tabs are reordered within the window they are in
  - Reports `Moved {n} of {m}` — Firefox refuses some moves silently, chiefly moving an
    unpinned tab in front of a pinned one, and a refused tab is absent from the result
- `tabs_capture_screenshot(filename=None, window_id=None, format="png", quality=90)` - Capture screenshot of visible tab
  - If `filename` provided: saves screenshot to file and returns success message
  - If `filename` omitted: returns base64 encoded image data URL
  - Automatically adds file extension (.png/.jpeg) if not provided

### History Operations
- `history_query(query, max_results=50)` - Search browser history
- `history_get_recent(count=10)` - Get recent history items
- `history_delete_item(url)` - Delete specific history item

### Bookmark Management
- `bookmarks_list(folder_id=None)` - List bookmarks from all folders or a specific folder
  - Returns formatted text with folder (📁) and bookmark (🔖) entries
  - Each item includes unique ID and parent folder ID for navigation
  - When `folder_id` is provided, returns only direct children of that folder
- `bookmarks_search(query)` - Search bookmarks by title or URL
  - Returns formatted text with matching bookmark entries including ID and parent folder ID
- `bookmarks_create(title, url, parent_id=None)` - Create bookmark
- `bookmarks_create_folder(title, parent_id=None)` - Create bookmark folder
- `bookmarks_update(bookmark_id, title=None, url=None)` - Update bookmark or folder title/URL
- `bookmarks_delete(bookmark_id)` - Delete bookmark

### Navigation Control
- `navigation_back(tab_id)` - Navigate back in tab
- `navigation_forward(tab_id)` - Navigate forward in tab
- `navigation_reload(tab_id, bypass_cache=False)` - Reload tab
- `navigation_go_to_url(tab_id, url)` - Navigate to URL

### Content Access
- `content_get_text(tab_id, max_length=None)` - Extract page text content
  - `max_length`: Optional maximum length of text to return (default: unlimited)
- `content_get_html(tab_id)` - Get page HTML source
- `content_execute_script(tab_id, script)` - Execute JavaScript directly
- `content_execute_predefined(tab_id, script_name, script_args="")` - Execute predefined external scripts

### Web Request Monitoring
- `requests_start_monitoring(url_patterns, options=None, tab_id=None)` - Start monitoring web requests
  - `url_patterns`: List of URL patterns to monitor (e.g., `["https://api.example.com/*", "*/api/*"]`)
  - `options`: Optional configuration dict with capture settings
  - `tab_id`: Optional tab ID to monitor (if not provided, monitors all tabs)
  - Returns JSON with `monitor_id` and monitoring status
- `requests_stop_monitoring(monitor_id, drain_timeout=5)` - Stop monitoring
  - `monitor_id`: ID of the monitoring session to stop
  - `drain_timeout`: **ignored** — the monitor stops immediately
  - Returns JSON with stop status and statistics
  - Captured data outlives the monitor: the two tools below still answer afterwards
- `requests_list_captured(monitor_id)` - List captured request summaries
  - Returns JSON with array of request summaries (metadata only, no full content)
  - A request appears once it has completed, so a navigation started a moment ago
    is not in the list yet
  - `MONITOR_NOT_FOUND` for an id that never existed or has been cleared. Monitors
    are cleared when the client that started them disconnects, and when the
    extension loses its connection to the server
- `requests_get_content(monitor_id, request_id, include_binary=False, save_request_body_to=None, save_response_body_to=None)` - Get full request/response content
  - `include_binary`: **ignored** — non-text bodies never come back as content, only as a size
  - `save_request_body_to`, `save_response_body_to`: **ignored** — `saved_to_file` is always `null`
  - Returns JSON with response headers and both bodies. `request_headers` is always
    empty: no listener collects them

See [web-request-monitoring.md](web-request-monitoring.md) for the options, the
pattern syntax, where captured data lives, and the full list of parameters that are
accepted and ignored.

#### What response body capture actually delivers

The `webRequest` API does not expose response bodies, so the extension taps the
response stream itself with `webRequest.filterResponseData`. That covers every
matching request, the document load included, and Firefox has already undone any
`Content-Encoding` by the time the bytes arrive — so what you get back is the
real body, not a compressed one.

**You get a body only if you asked for its content type.** `content` is filled
in when the response is text *and* its content type matches
`content_types_to_capture` — which defaults to
`["application/json", "text/plain"]`. An HTML page therefore returns no content
unless you pass `content_types_to_capture: ["text/html"]`. Binary responses
never return content, whatever you pass. In every one of these cases `included`
is `false`, `content` is `null`, and `note` says which reason applied.

**`size_bytes` is the whole body, even when `content` is not.** It counts the
bytes Firefox delivered, so it is right for a body dropped for its content type
and right for one cut short by `max_body_size`; `truncated` is what tells you
the `content` you were given is short of `size_bytes`. It is not read from
`Content-Length`, which compressed HTTP/2 responses routinely omit. `size_bytes` is `null` only when the response could
not be tapped at all: monitoring did not ask for bodies, or Firefox refused the
filter, which it does for a redirect and for a response served from its
alternate-data cache.

`requests_list_captured` is unaffected by any of this. Request metadata comes
from `webRequest` and is captured for every matching request.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tab Operations
```python
# List all tabs
tabs = await client.call_tool("tabs_list")

# Create new tab
result = await client.call_tool("tabs_create", {"url": "https://example.com"})

# Take screenshot
screenshot = await client.call_tool("tabs_capture_screenshot", {"format": "png"})
```

### Gathering Tabs Into Their Own Window
```python
# Find the tabs to gather. Every window is listed, and each line ends with
# "[window {id}, index {n}]", so the tab IDs can be picked out of the listing.
listing = await client.call_tool("tabs_list")

# Open the window they are going to
window = await client.call_tool("create_window", {"url": "about:blank"})
window_id = int(re.search(r'ID (\d+)', window["content"]).group(1))

# Move them in, keeping the given order, appended at the end
await client.call_tool("tabs_move", {"tab_ids": [12, 15, 18], "window_id": window_id})

# Confirm they arrived, and nothing else came along
await client.call_tool("tabs_list", {"window_id": window_id})
```

The new window opens with a blank tab of its own, which stays until closed with
`tabs_close`. Its ID is in the scoped `tabs_list` above.

### Reordering Tabs
```python
# Move one tab to the front of its window
await client.call_tool("tabs_move", {"tab_ids": 12, "index": 0})

# Move several to the end, in the order given
await client.call_tool("tabs_move", {"tab_ids": [12, 15], "index": -1})
```

### History and Bookmarks
```python
# Search history
history = await client.call_tool("history_query", {"query": "python", "max_results": 10})

# List bookmarks
bookmarks = await client.call_tool("bookmarks_list")

# Create bookmark
bookmark = await client.call_tool("bookmarks_create", {
    "title": "Example Site",
    "url": "https://example.com"
})

# Create bookmark folder
folder = await client.call_tool("bookmarks_create_folder", {
    "title": "My Projects"
})

# Create bookmark in folder
bookmark = await client.call_tool("bookmarks_create", {
    "title": "Project Repository",
    "url": "https://github.com/example/project",
    "parent_id": "folder_id_here"
})

# Update bookmark title
await client.call_tool("bookmarks_update", {
    "bookmark_id": "bookmark_id_here",
    "title": "New Title"
})

# Update bookmark URL
await client.call_tool("bookmarks_update", {
    "bookmark_id": "bookmark_id_here",
    "url": "https://newsite.com"
})

# Rename a folder
await client.call_tool("bookmarks_update", {
    "bookmark_id": "folder_id_here",
    "title": "Renamed Folder"
})
```

### Content Interaction
```python
# Get page text (unlimited)
text = await client.call_tool("content_get_text", {"tab_id": 123})

# Get page text with length limit
text = await client.call_tool("content_get_text", {
    "tab_id": 123,
    "max_length": 1000
})

# Execute JavaScript
result = await client.call_tool("content_execute_script", {
    "tab_id": 123,
    "script": "document.title"
})
```

### Window Management
```python
# List all windows
windows = await client.call_tool("list_windows", {"populate": True})

# Create new window
window = await client.call_tool("create_window", {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
})

# Focus window
await client.call_tool("focus_window", {"window_id": 456})
```
